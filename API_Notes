These are notes for implementing a basic Fortran interface for ASDF
so that SPECFEM3D_GLOBE can natively output the format in parallel

	1) call generate_QuakeML (on master processer)
			creates QuakeML String
        2) call generate_StationXML_strings (on master)
			creates all StationXML String
        3) Broadcast length of QuakemL and length of StationXML and number of receivers 
		Define QuakeML byte array (on master processor)

	Each Core:
		Create file format and version attributes
		Create QuakeML Dataset
		Create StationXML & groups & StationXML_datasets
		Create the Waveform Group
        call Barrier
	Master writes QuakeML & StationXML
	Workers write waveforms, sample_rates, start_times
	1) call generate_StationXML_files (on master processor)
	all cores generate folder structure so broadcast folder name, length of stationXML
        all cores should create_dataset with lenght of stationXML and type
        master processer writes the StationXML files
	2) Write the Stations to the File
		Write StationXML
